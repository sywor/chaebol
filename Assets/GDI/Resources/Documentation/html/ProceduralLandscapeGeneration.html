	<h1>Procedural Landscape Generation</h1>
	<p>
		GDI contains nodes that help you create worlds based on procedural landscape generation.
		This is based on nodes that create different noise types, nodes that help to shape
		height maps, nodes that scatter game entities over the landscape, chunk generation
		mechanisms and so on.
	</p>

	<p>
		Take a look at the example graphs in the package to find out more how procedural landscape generation
		works in GDI.
