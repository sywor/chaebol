		<h3 id="connectiontypes">Connection Types</h3>
		<p>
			To create a custom connection type for your nodes you need to write a simple interface class
			that defines the the request method of this connection. For example the <b>IColorConnection</b>
			interface can return a color and expects an request parameter to compute it. All nodes implementing that interface
			are able to return colors.
		</p>

<pre><code class="cs cscode"><span class="cscode-keyword">public</span> <span class="cscode-keyword">interface</span> <span class="cscode-title">IColorConnection</span>
{
	<span class="hljs-function">Color <span class="cscode-title">GetColor</span>(<span class="hljs-params">OutputSocket socket, Request request</span>)</span>;
}
</code></pre>
		<p>
			The <b>OutputSocket</b> parameter tells the implementing node which output socket is requested. This is useful
			if your node contains multiple output sockets of the same connection type.
		</p>
		<p>
			In GDI every connection type has its own edge color for a better overview in the editor. The information about
			the color is obtained in the <b>Node.cs</b> class. To register a color for your custom connection find the
			static method <b>GetEdgeColor</b> in this class.
		</p>

<pre><code class="cs">public static Color GetEdgeColor(Type connectionType)
{
	// ...
	if (connectionType == typeof(IColorConnection)) return AbstractColorNode.EdgeColor;
	// ...
}
</code></pre>

	<p>
		The method maps a connection type to its color and returns it. In the case of the <b>IColorConnection</b> a static
		member of <b>AbstractColorNode</b> is used for the color. You could also directly return a color here or write
		an abstract class for your custom connection that contains the color.
	</p>

		<h3>Abstract Node Classes</h3>
		<p>
			You can write an abstract class for custom connection types as well. This classes are just helper classes that are
			optional. They usually have a static helper function for the connection type and can contain the edge color.
			Take a look at the existing abstract node classes if you like but you do not have to use them.
		</p>

		<h3 id="requestparameter">Request Parameter</h3>
		<p>
			Every connection interface should contain the request parameter in its method signature. Based on this
			parameter the node computes its return value.
		</p>

<pre><code class="cs">public struct Request
{
	public float X;
	public float Y;
	public float Z;
	public float Seed;
	public float SizeX;
	public float SizeY;
	public float SizeZ;
}</code></pre>

	<p>
		Keep in mind that a connection type can have its own interpretation of the request parameter but
		should be compatible with other nodes.
	</p>
	<p>
		For example: nodes that are implementing the <b>IColorConnection</b> interface usually bypassing the
		parameter and do not use it. One exception is the <a href="nodes/GradientNode.html">GradientNode</a>.
		It uses the <i>Y</i> field of the request parameter to return the gradient color at this position.
	</p>
	<p>
		Nodes that are returning numbers and implementing the <b>INumberConnection</b> interface often use the parameter.
		For example: the <a href="nodes/NoiseNode.html">NoiseNode</a> can return float values in 2 dimensions. For that
		reason the <i>X</i> and <i>Z</i> parameter is used. A node that creates a map of noise values like the
		<a href="nodes/DisplayMapNode.html">DisplayMapNode</a> simply requests a connected noise node for every position
		of the map. If also requests a connected gradient color node for every received number as the <i>Y</i> parameter.
	</p>

	<blockquote>
		Why do number nodes not return an array of numbers using <i>SizeX</i> and <i>SizeZ?</i>
		This is to avoid creating array instances for each node. We also can not create the array in
		one root node and just return the reference because of thread safety.
	</blockquote>

	<p>
		If you want to create custom connection types that are working well with the existing nodes you
		need to take a look how they are using the request parameter. You could also add more members to the
		request parameter but sometimes it is better to use one of the exiting ones in a clever, compatible way.
	</p>

		<h3 id="customevaluation">Custom Graph Evaluation</h3>
		<p>
			Writing a custom graph update and parse logic is an advanced topic. GDI implements a directed graph
			without cyclic dependencies.
		</p>
		<p>
			A cyclic dependency is defined like this: A cyclic dependency should be detected if any OutputSocket
			of a Node has a indirect/direct path to any of its InputSockets. The path leads through OutputSockets only.
		</p>
		<p>
			A cyclic dependency could lead to the situation that a node requests a value that is based on the
			same request. This would lead to a recursive request call and cause Unity to crash.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you create a custom graph evaluation logic you need to be aware of issues like cyclic dependency.
			There are uses cases where you want to allow cycles anyway and evaluate the request values step by step.
			Take a look at the <b>StandardGraphController</b> class to find out more about the updating logic. Also take
			a look at the <b>Graph</b> class where you find the logic of parsing the graph, detecting cycles and allow/deny
			socket links.
